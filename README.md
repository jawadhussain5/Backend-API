# Backend API 

This is a basic backend server with two APIs.

- API 1: http://IP-ADDRESS:3000/
- API 2: http://IP-ADDRESS:3000/todo
- To find your IP address, you can use the ipconfig command on Windows or ifconfig command on Linux/Mac in your terminal.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version X.X.X or higher)

## Installation

1. Check Node.js version by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   node --version
2. Make sure the output shows a version equal to or higher than X.X.X.

3. git clone https://github.com/TalalBhatti/Backend-API.git

4. cd your-repo

5. npm install

6. node index.js

This will start the application and you can access it at http://localhost:3000.
